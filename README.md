# Supervised Machine Learning Homework - Predicting Credit Risk

In this assignment, a machine learning model will be built that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. 

## Background

Lending services companies allow individual investors to partially fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. This data will be used to 

This data will be used to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier will be compared.

## Instructions

### Retrieved the data

The data was retrieved.

* `lending_data.csv`

The data was imported using Pandas.

## Considered the models

First, a prediction was made as to which model would perform better followed by creating and comparing the models.

## Fitted a LogisticRegression model and a RandomForestClassifier model

A LogisticRegression model was made, fitted to the data, and the model's score was printed. The same was done for a RandomForestClassifier. 

## Analysis

An analysis was made that compared the two models and compared to the prediction made earlier.
